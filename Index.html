<!--The Password is
I HAVE SOME GOOD news. Next month, The Atlantic will once again send fiction home to our subscribers, in a special supplement that will accompany our May issue. On the newsstand, the supplement will be bound into the May magazine.

The short story has been integral to 
The Atlantic since 
our first issue, in 1857
, in which we published
 four stories,
 including “The Mourning
 Veil,” by Harriet Beecher Stowe
. But as longtime, generously loyal
 readers know, for the past five
 years we have published fiction once a year
 in a special newsstand issue, rather than
 in any of our 10 subscriber issues. During
 what has been widely noted to be a “challenging” (read:
 harrowing) business environment for publishing, this has
 been a necessary compromise
. But none of us has been particularly happy
 with it, and we have been searching
 for ways to once again place great fiction in
 front of all our readers.-->
